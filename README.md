# Calculator Starter Code

### What does this project do?
* Acts as a calculator and does:
    * Subtraction
    * Addition
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Natural Logs (base 10)
    * Square Roots
    * Powers
    * Random Number Generator

### How does this project function?
 Uses JavaScript to return different values for each function that pertains different operations.
 
 It would function by entering a number, selecting a operation, and then entering another number.
 
 For Logs and Square Roots, one would have to select the operation, and then enter the number.

### Things I would add to this project if I had more time:
* Allow decimals to be used
* Factorials
* A way to solve equations
* Complex numbers (i)
